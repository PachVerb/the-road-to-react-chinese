# 前言

> The Road to React teaches the fundamentals of React. You will build a real-world application in plain React without complicated tooling. Everything from project setup to deployment on a server will be explained for you. The book comes with additional referenced reading material and exercises with each chapter. After reading the book, you will be able to build your own applications in React. The material is kept up to date by myself and the community.

《通向 React 之路》旨在讲授 React 基础知识。你将会用 React 搭建一个真实的应用程序，无需其他复杂的工具。从项目初始化到服务器部署，我会为你详细讲解其中每一步，并在每一章都附有参考资料和练习。读完此书后你将能够搭建自己的 React 应用。我和社区会保证这些材料始终是最新的。

>  In the Road to React, I offer a foundation before you dive into the broader React ecosystem. The concepts will have less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information about React. It explains general concepts, patterns, and best practices in a real world React application.

在深入到广阔的 React 生态系统之前，应该先打稳基础。我会用更关注 React 本身的方式来讲解它的概念，尽量减少工具和外部状态管理的使用，从而提供更多关于 React 自身的知识。我会用到一个真实的 React 应用来讲解这些通用概念、模式和最佳实践。

> Essentially, you will learn to build your own React application from scratch, with features like pagination, client-side and server-side searching, and advanced interactions like sorting. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript, and that it helps you get started with it.

大体上你将会学到如何从头开始写一个 React 应用，包含分页、客户端和服务端搜索，以及一些高级的交互方式，例如排序等等。希望在阅读本书的过程中能让你感受到我对 React 和 JavaScript 的热爱，让它们伴你一同走进 React 的世界。

## About the Author

## 关于作者

> I am a German software and web engineer dedicated to learning and teaching programming in JavaScript. After obtaining my Master's Degree in computer science, I continued learning on my own. I gained experience from the startup world, where I used JavaScript intensively during both my professional life and spare time, which eventually led to a desire to teach others about these topics.

我是一名来自德国的软件和互联网工程师，致力于学习和教授 JavaScript 编程。在获得计算机科学硕士学位后，我没有停止过自我学习。在初创公司的那段日子里，无论是工作还是业余时间，我整天都在和 JavaScript 打交道。这段经历使我积攒了大量经验，也最终引领我走向了 JavaScript 传道者之路。

> For a few years, I worked closely with an exceptional team of engineers at a company called Small Improvements, developing large scale applications. The company offered a SaaS product that enables customers to give feedback to businesses. This application was developed using JavaScript on its frontend, and Java as its backend. The first iteration of Small Improvements' frontend was written in Java with the Wicket Framework and jQuery. When the first generation of SPAs became popular, the company migrated to Angular 1.x for its frontend application. After using Angular for over two years, it became clear that Angular wasn't the best solution to work with state intense applications, so they made the jump to React and Redux. This enabled it to operate on a large scale successfully.

有几年，我和一群出类拔萃的工程师一起在一家叫做 Small Improvements 的公司工作，开发大型应用程序。公司经营的是一款 SaaS 产品，能够让客户提供反馈给商家。产品的前端是用的是 JavaScript，后端是 Java。在最初的版本使用的是 Java 的 Wicket 框架和 jQuery。没过多久，第一代 SPA（单页面应用）开始流行起来，公司决定把前端迁移到 Angular 1.x 。然而在和 Angular 纠缠了两年多以后，我们渐渐发现它并不是管理复杂多变的应用状态的最佳方案，转而投入了 React 和 Redux 的怀抱，这使得产品大获成功。

> During my time in the company, I regularly wrote articles about web development on my website. I received great feedback from people learning from my articles which allowed me to improve my writing and teaching style. Article after article, I grew my ability to teach others. I felt that my first articles were packed with too much information, quite overwhelming for students, but I improved by focusing on one subject at a time.

我在公司时，会定期地在我的网站上写一些关于 Web 开发的文章。感谢那时的读者给了我很多很棒的反馈，让我的写作和教学水平得到了提升。就这样日积月累，我渐渐习得了教练技巧。我发现我早期的文章里倾向于包含过量的信息，让学生不堪重负，我慢慢地学会了每次只关注一个主题。

> Currently, I am a self-employed software engineer and educator. I find it a fulfilling pastime to see students thrive by giving them clear objectives and short feedback loops. You can find more information about me and ways to support and work with me on my [website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about).

现在我是作为自由职业者在继续软件开发工程师和教育者的工作。通过设定明确的目标和短期反馈环，我能看到学生们可以得到快速成长，我的成就感也来源于此。我的[网站]((https://www.robinwieruch.de/about))上有更多关于我个人的信息，以及如何支持或和我一起工作的方式。

* > JavaScript veterans coming from jQuery: If you have used JavaScript with jQuery, MooTools, and Dojo extensively back in the days, the new JavaScript era may seem overwhelming for someone getting back on track with it. However, most of the fundamental knowledge didn't change, it's still JavaScript and HTML under the hood, so this book should give you the right start into React.

* 从 jQuery 时代来的 JavaScript 老手：如果你在 jQuery、MooTools 和 Dojo 的年代大量使用过 JavaScript，可能会和当下的 JavaScript 趋势有点难以接轨。然而它们底层其实从来没有变过，依然是 JavaScript 和 HTML，所以本书应该可以帮你用正确的姿势开始学习 React。

* > JavaScript enthusiasts with knowledge in other modern SPA frameworks: If you are coming from Angular or Vue, there may be lots of differences in how to write applications with React, however, all these frameworks share the same fundamentals of JavaScript and HTML. After a mindset shift to get comfortable with React, you should be doing just fine adopting React.

* JavaScript 爱好者，已有其他现代单页面应用框架的经验：如果你用过 Angular 或者 Vue，虽然 React 应用写起来会很不一样，但这些框架的基础构件都是 JavaScript 和 HTML。一旦适应了用 React 的方式去思考问题，这对你来说就不是什么问题了。

* > If you are coming from another programming language, you should be more familiar than others about the different aspects of programming. After picking up the fundamentals about JavaScript and HTML, you should have a good time learning React with me.
